## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use
- **Every Friday** - End of week review and planning
- **Before stage transitions** - Comprehensive assessment
- **After major milestones** - Project health check
- **When feeling stuck** - Identify blockers and solutions

### How to Use
1. **Be Honest**: Realistic assessment of progress and challenges
2. **Include Metrics**: Specific numbers where possible (frame rates, completion times)
3. **Plan Realistically**: Set achievable goals for next week
4. **Document Decisions**: Capture reasoning behind architectural choices
5. **Assess Risks**: Identify potential problems before they become critical

### Quality Example

```
## üìà PROGRESS SUMMARY
**Features Completed This Week:**
- Web Audio API integration with 5 sound effects (connect, complete, error, ambient, success)
- Save system using localStorage with progress persistence across sessions
- Tutorial overlay system for first-time players with interactive guidance

**Development Velocity:**
- Faster than last week (completed 3 major features vs 2 last week)
- Benefiting from established patterns and workflow efficiency

**Blockers Resolved:**
- Audio latency issues on mobile Safari resolved with Web Audio context initialization
- Touch event conflicts with scroll gestures fixed using passive: false

**New Blockers Identified:**
- localStorage size limits becoming concern with detailed progress tracking
- Level generation algorithm needs optimization for complex patterns

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE & CODE HEALTH
**New Patterns Introduced:**
- Audio manager singleton pattern for centralized sound control
- Observer pattern for game state changes and UI updates

**Technical Debt Status:**
- **Created:** Temporary hardcoded audio file paths (needs asset loading system)
- **Resolved:** Refactored particle system to use object pooling
- **Overall Level:** Low (well-managed, no critical issues)

**Performance Impact:**
- Audio system adds ~50KB to bundle size, no frame rate impact
- Save system negligible performance impact, < 1ms operations

## üìÖ NEXT WEEK PLANNING
**Priority 1 (Must Complete):**
1. Power-up system foundation - 12 hours - Core gameplay enhancement ready for testing

**Priority 2 (Should Complete):**
1. Achievement system basic framework - 8 hours - Player engagement and retention
2. Level editor prototype - 6 hours - User-generated content potential

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have):**
1. Advanced particle effects for power-ups - 4 hours - Visual polish enhancement
```

## Success Indicators

A good weekly review should result in:
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of actual progress vs planned progress
- ‚úÖ Realistic goals for the upcoming week
- ‚úÖ Identified risks with mitigation strategies
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation priorities
- ‚úÖ Maintained or improved development velocity

## Red Flags

Watch for these warning signs in your weekly reviews:
- üö® **Consistently missing goals** ‚Üí Reevaluate planning approach
- üö® **Growing technical debt** ‚Üí Allocate time for cleanup
- üö® **Unclear priorities** ‚Üí Better goal setting needed
- üö® **No performance metrics** ‚Üí Add measurement and monitoring
- üö® **Avoiding difficult tasks** ‚Üí Break down into smaller pieces

Remember: The weekly review is your opportunity to course-correct before problems become critical. Be honest about challenges and celebrate genuine progress.
