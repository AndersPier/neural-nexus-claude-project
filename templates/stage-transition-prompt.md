## Stage-Specific Guidance

### Exploration ‚Üí Prototype
**Key Questions:**
- Have we validated our core concept with working examples?
- Are our technology choices proven and documented?
- Do we have a clear scope for the prototype?
- Have we identified and mitigated major technical risks?

### Prototype ‚Üí Development
**Key Questions:**
- Does our core functionality work as expected?
- Is our architecture scalable and maintainable?
- Have we validated user value proposition?
- Are performance targets achievable?

### Development ‚Üí Production
**Key Questions:**
- Are all planned features complete and tested?
- Is our deployment process reliable and documented?
- Do we have monitoring and error handling in place?
- Is our documentation comprehensive and current?

## Transition Best Practices

### Before Initiating Transition
1. **Complete Current Stage Goals**: Don't rush to next stage with incomplete work
2. **Document Everything**: Ensure all decisions and learnings are captured
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate that current stage success criteria are met
4. **Plan Next Stage**: Have clear goals and priorities for the new stage

### During Transition
1. **Archive Appropriately**: Save current stage work without cluttering new stage
2. **Update All Documentation**: Ensure consistency across all project files
3. **Communicate Changes**: Update project descriptions and instructions
4. **Establish New Metrics**: Define success criteria for the new stage

### After Transition
1. **Validate New Setup**: Ensure Claude Project is properly configured
2. **Test Workflow**: Confirm new stage processes work smoothly
3. **Monitor Early Progress**: Watch for any context or workflow issues
4. **Adjust as Needed**: Fine-tune processes based on early new stage experience

Remember: Stage transitions are major milestones that deserve proper attention and documentation. Don't rush them!
