4. The game works great in full-screen mode!

### Step 2: First Time Playing

When you first open Neural Nexus, you'll see:

1. **The Game Title** - "NEURAL NEXUS" at the top
2. **Your Stats** - Level, Score, and Time remaining
3. **The Game Area** - Where all the action happens
4. **Welcome Instructions** - Click "START NEURAL LINK" to begin!

### Step 3: Controls Overview

**On Computer:**
- **Mouse Click & Drag** - Connect nodes by clicking one node and dragging to another
- **Mouse Move** - See connection preview as you drag

**On Mobile:**
- **Tap & Drag** - Touch one node and drag your finger to another node
- **Pinch to Zoom** - Zoom in/out if needed (on some devices)

## Basic Features

### üéØ **Core Gameplay**

**What it does:** Connect nodes to match the target pattern shown as dotted lines

**How to play:**
1. Look at the dotted white lines - these show which nodes need to be connected
2. Click (or tap) on any node
3. Drag to another node to create a glowing connection
4. Repeat until all dotted lines are recreated with solid connections
5. Complete the pattern before time runs out!

**Example:** If you see a dotted line between a green node and blue node, drag from the green node to the blue node to create that connection.

### üìä **Scoring System**

**What it does:** Tracks your progress and performance

**How scoring works:**
- **Base Points:** 100 points per level completed
- **Time Bonus:** 10 points for each second remaining when you finish
- **Level Multiplier:** Higher levels give more points
- **Perfect Completion:** Bonus points for completing without mistakes

### ‚è∞ **Timer Challenge**

**What it does:** Each level has a time limit that creates urgency and excitement

**How it works:**
- Start with 60 seconds for early levels
- Time decreases slightly as levels get harder
- Complete the pattern before time runs out
- Faster completion = higher score!

## Game Mechanics

### Node Types

üü¢ **Source Nodes (Green):** Starting points - these often begin patterns  
üîµ **Normal Nodes (Blue):** Standard connection points  
üü† **Target Nodes (Orange):** End points - these often complete patterns  

### Connection Rules

‚úÖ **Valid Connections:**
- Any node can connect to any other node
- Connections are bidirectional (work both ways)
- You can have multiple connections per node

‚ùå **Invalid Connections:**
- Cannot connect a node to itself
- Cannot create duplicate connections between the same two nodes

### Level Progression

**Level 1-5:** Learn the basics with simple patterns  
**Level 6-15:** Increased complexity with more nodes  
**Level 16-25:** Advanced patterns requiring strategy  
**Level 26+:** Master-level challenges for experts  

## Tips & Tricks

### üí° Strategy Tips

1. **Study First, Connect Second**
   - Take 5-10 seconds to examine the dotted pattern
   - Plan your connection order mentally
   - Look for obvious connections first (isolated nodes, clear pairs)

2. **Work Outside-In**
   - Start with nodes on the edges of the pattern
   - Connect obvious pairs first
   - Save complex central connections for last

3. **Use Color Coding**
   - Green source nodes often start chains
   - Orange target nodes often end chains
   - Blue nodes are usually connectors in the middle

### üåü Performance Tips

1. **Time Management**
   - Don't rush - mistakes waste more time than careful planning
   - If stuck, take a deep breath and look for simpler connections
   - Remember: you get bonus points for leftover time

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Look for symmetrical patterns
   - Identify chain sequences (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíD)
   - Notice hub nodes that connect to many others

3. **Accuracy Over Speed**
   - It's better to be accurate than fast
   - One careful connection is worth three hasty mistakes
   - Build confidence with correct connections

### üì± Mobile-Specific Tips

- **Larger Touch Targets:** Use the tip of your finger, not the side
- **Steady Movements:** Smooth drags work better than jerky motions
- **Landscape Mode:** Try rotating your device for easier reaching
- **Zoom if Needed:** Use pinch gestures if nodes are too small

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "I can't make connections"
**Try this:**
1. Make sure you're starting the drag on a node (colored circle)
2. Drag all the way to the target node before releasing
3. Check that you're not trying to connect a node to itself
4. Ensure you're not creating a duplicate connection

#### "The game is running slowly"
**Solutions:**
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
- Try refreshing the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Close unnecessary programs on your device
- Make sure your device isn't overheating

#### "Touch controls aren't working on mobile"
**Check these:**
- Try using just one finger
- Make sure your screen is clean
- Restart the browser app
- Try in landscape mode
- Ensure you're touching directly on the nodes

#### "I can't see the dotted pattern clearly"
**Possible fixes:**
- Adjust your screen brightness
- Try a different viewing angle
- Look for very faint white dotted lines
- The pattern might be simple - check for direct node-to-node connections

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Gameplay Questions

**Q: How do I know which nodes to connect?**
A: Look for the faint dotted white lines connecting nodes - these show you exactly which connections to make. Your job is to recreate these dotted lines with solid, glowing connections.

**Q: Can I undo a connection?**
A: Currently, you cannot undo individual connections. If you make a mistake, you'll need to complete the level or let the timer run out to start over.

**Q: What happens when I complete a level?**
A: You'll see a "Neural Network Complete!" message, your score will increase, and you'll automatically advance to the next level with a new pattern to solve.

**Q: Is there a maximum level?**
A: The game generates increasingly complex levels automatically, so there's always a new challenge waiting!

### Technical Questions

**Q: What devices does Neural Nexus work on?**
A: Neural Nexus works on:
- Desktop computers (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Smartphones (iPhone, Android)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)
- Any device with a modern web browser

**Q: Do I need to download anything?**
A: No! Neural Nexus runs entirely in your web browser. No downloads, installations, or accounts required.

**Q: Does the game save my progress?**
A: Your current session progress is maintained while playing, but progress doesn't persist between browser sessions yet. We're working on adding save functionality!

**Q: Can I play offline?**
A: You need an internet connection to load the game initially, but once loaded, it should work without internet for your current session.
