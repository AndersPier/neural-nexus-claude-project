### Decision 005: Progressive Difficulty Algorithm
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Context:** Game balance and player engagement strategy  
**Decision:** Algorithmic difficulty scaling based on level progression  
**Rationale:**
- Maintains challenge as players improve
- Prevents frustration through gradual increase
- Allows fine-tuning based on player data
- Infinite content generation capability

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const nodeCount = Math.min(5 + Math.floor(level * 0.7), 12);
const timeLimit = Math.max(45, 60 - Math.floor(level / 3) * 2);
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Fixed difficulty levels
- Player-selected difficulty
- Adaptive difficulty based on performance

**Impact:** Core to long-term player engagement and retention  
**Status:** Current

---

### Decision 006: Mobile-First Responsive Design
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Context:** Cross-platform compatibility requirements  
**Decision:** Design primarily for mobile, enhance for desktop  
**Rationale:**
- Puzzle games popular on mobile devices
- Touch interaction naturally translates to mouse
- Ensures excellent mobile experience
- Larger touch targets benefit accessibility

**Implementation Approach:**
- Base styles for mobile (320px+)
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Touch target minimum 44px
- Gesture-based interactions

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Desktop-first with mobile adaptation
- Separate mobile and desktop versions
- Mobile-only approach

**Impact:** Influences all UI design and interaction patterns  
**Status:** Current

### Decision 007: GitHub-Based Dual Repository Structure
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Context:** Project organization and documentation strategy  
**Decision:** Separate repositories for game code and Claude Project methodology  
**Rationale:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Game repository showcases development skills
- Claude Project repository demonstrates systematic approach
- Both serve as templates for future projects

**Repository Structure:**
- `neural-nexus-game`: Game code and development documentation
- `neural-nexus-claude-project`: Claude Project workflow and methodology

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single repository with folders
- Multiple repositories for different aspects
- Documentation-only repository

**Impact:** Creates reusable development methodology and clean portfolio pieces  
**Status:** Current

---

### Decision 008: Session-Based Development Workflow
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Context:** Claude Project context management and knowledge retention  
**Decision:** Structured session start/end workflow with mandatory consolidation  
**Rationale:**
- Prevents context loss between sessions
- Captures decisions and rationale systematically
- Builds knowledge base incrementally
- Maintains development momentum

**Workflow Components:**
- Session start prompt for context setting
- Mandatory session end consolidation
- Weekly progress reviews
- Stage transition assessments

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Ad-hoc development without structure
- Daily summary instead of session-based
- Automated context capture

**Impact:** Ensures consistent progress and knowledge retention  
**Status:** Current

## Decision Review Process

### Monthly Reviews
- Assess whether decisions are achieving intended goals
- Identify decisions that may need modification
- Document lessons learned from implementation
- Plan updates based on new information or changing requirements

### Decision Modification Process
1. Document current status and why change is needed
2. Analyze impact on existing implementation
3. Consider alternatives within current constraints
4. Plan implementation strategy
5. Update related documentation
6. Communicate changes to team/stakeholders

### Decision Success Metrics
- **Technical Decisions**: Performance targets, maintainability, scalability
- **Design Decisions**: User satisfaction, engagement metrics, accessibility
- **Process Decisions**: Development velocity, knowledge retention, team efficiency
