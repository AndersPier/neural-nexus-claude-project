## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Audio Implementation**: Browser autoplay policies may require workarounds
- **Save System**: localStorage limitations may affect large save files
- **Mobile Performance**: Older devices may struggle with particle effects

### Mitigation Strategies
- Audio: Implement user-initiated audio with fallback to silent mode
- Save: Implement data compression and cleanup routines
- Performance: Add quality settings for older devices

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- 90% of users complete tutorial without confusion
- Average session time >7 minutes
- 70% completion rate for first 15 levels
- 60fps performance on 95% of test devices

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- User-generated levels created and shared
- 80% of users engage with power-up system
- Social sharing generates measurable traffic
- Player retention >50% after 1 week

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- Successful app store approval and distribution
- 1000+ active users within first month
- Positive review scores (>4.0/5.0)
- Sustainable development workflow established

## Dependencies and Constraints

### External Dependencies
- None currently (vanilla JavaScript approach)
- Future: App store approval processes
- Future: Cloud service providers for multiplayer

### Development Constraints
- Single developer team (affects timeline)
- Performance targets must be maintained
- Mobile-first design approach
- Zero external dependencies preference

## Continuous Improvement

### Weekly Reviews
- Assess feature completion against timeline
- Gather user feedback from testing sessions
- Monitor performance metrics and optimize
- Update roadmap based on discoveries

### Monthly Milestones
- Phase completion assessments
- User testing with external participants
- Technical debt review and cleanup
- Strategic direction validation
