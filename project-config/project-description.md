**STAGE:** Prototype Development
**PRODUCT CONCEPT:** Modern HTML5 puzzle game featuring neural network connectivity challenges

**VALIDATED ASSUMPTIONS FROM EXPLORATION:**
- ‚úì HTML5 Canvas provides smooth 60fps performance for this game type
- ‚úì Modern CSS effects (glassmorphism, gradients) create appealing visual experience  
- ‚úì Touch/mouse interaction patterns work seamlessly across all devices
- ‚úì Progressive difficulty scaling maintains player engagement without frustration

**PROTOTYPE SCOPE:**
- **Core Feature:** Connect nodes to form target network patterns under time pressure
- **Success Metric:** Smooth gameplay with engaging progression through 50+ levels
- **Explicit Non-Goals:** Multiplayer, social features, monetization systems (for now)

**CHOSEN TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5/JavaScript ES6+ for maximum performance and control
- **Graphics:** Canvas 2D API with CSS animations for UI elements
- **Architecture:** Object-oriented game components (Node, Connection, GameState classes)
- **Performance:** RequestAnimationFrame game loop with efficient rendering techniques

**BUILD STATUS:**
- ‚úÖ Core game mechanics: Node connection system working flawlessly
- ‚úÖ Level generation: Dynamic difficulty scaling with 25+ test levels
- ‚úÖ Visual effects: Particle systems and modern glassmorphism UI complete
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform: Touch and mouse controls optimized for all devices
- üîÑ Audio integration: Sound effects and background music implementation
- ‚è≥ Save system: Local storage for progress and high scores
- ‚è≥ Advanced features: Power-ups, achievements, level editor planning

**CURRENT PRIORITY:** Audio system implementation and save game functionality
