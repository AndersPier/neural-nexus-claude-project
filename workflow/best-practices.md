# Best Practices for Claude Projects Development

## Core Principles

### The Golden Rules
1. **Never skip session wrap-ups** - 5 minutes of consolidation saves hours of context rebuilding
2. **Consolidate before you forget** - Document decisions while they're fresh in memory
3. **Trust the system** - Consistency in workflow compounds benefits over time
4. **Stage transitions are checkpoints** - Don't rush between development phases

### Documentation Discipline
- **Immediate Documentation**: Update docs as decisions are made, not later
- **Decision Rationale**: Always record why choices were made, not just what
- **Pattern Recognition**: Document successful approaches for reuse
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain enough detail for seamless session continuation

## Workflow Best Practices

### Daily Session Management

#### Session Startup (2 minutes)
```markdown
**Efficient Session Start:**
1. Review last session's wrap-up notes
2. Check current sprint priorities
3. Identify any blockers or dependencies
4. Set clear session objective
5. Use session-start prompt for context refresh
```

#### During Development (Continuous)
```markdown
**Productive Development Habits:**
- Test changes immediately on multiple devices
- Document architectural decisions as they're made
- Commit working code frequently with clear messages
- Monitor performance impact of new features
- Update knowledge base with discovered patterns
```

#### Session Closure (5 minutes - CRITICAL)
```markdown
**Never-Skip Session End:**
1. Use session-end prompt template (always)
2. Document key decisions and rationale
3. Set clear next session priority
4. Assess project health honestly
5. Update knowledge base with new patterns
6. Commit all changes with descriptive messages
```

### Knowledge Base Hygiene

#### Content Organization
```markdown
**Effective Knowledge Structure:**
- game-design/ - Mechanics, progression, user experience
- technical/ - Performance, architecture, cross-platform notes
- development/ - Roadmap, decisions, session logs
- Limit total size to <10MB for optimal Claude Project performance
```

#### Content Quality Standards
```markdown
**High-Quality Documentation:**
- Decision Format: Date, Context, Choice, Rationale, Trade-offs, Status
- Pattern Format: Problem, Solution, Code Example, When to Use, Variations
- Process Format: Objective, Steps, Success Criteria, Common Issues
- Always include working code examples, not just descriptions
```

#### Maintenance Routine
```markdown
**Weekly Knowledge Base Care:**
- Archive outdated information
- Update status of pending decisions
- Add new patterns discovered during development
- Reorganize content for better accessibility
- Ensure cross-references remain accurate
```

## Code Quality Practices

### Architecture Consistency
```javascript
// Example: Consistent naming and structure
class GameEntity {
  constructor(config = {}) {
    // Always provide defaults and validate inputs
    this.id = config.id || generateUniqueId();
    this.position = { x: config.x || 0, y: config.y || 0 };
    this.state = config.state || 'inactive';
  }
  
  update(deltaTime) {
    // Consistent update pattern across all entities
  }
  
  draw(context) {
    // Consistent rendering approach
  }
  
  destroy() {
    // Always implement cleanup
  }
}
```

### Performance-First Development
```javascript
// Example: Performance-conscious patterns
class PerformanceOptimizedRenderer {
  constructor() {
    this.dirtyRegions = [];
    this.frameRequest = null;
  }
  
  markDirty(region) {
    // Only redraw what changed
    this.dirtyRegions.push(region);
    if (!this.frameRequest) {
      this.frameRequest = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.render());
    }
  }
  
  render() {
    // Batch operations for efficiency
    this.dirtyRegions.forEach(region => this.redrawRegion(region));
    this.dirtyRegions.length = 0;
    this.frameRequest = null;
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Standards
```javascript
// Example: Robust error handling
async function robustGameOperation(operation) {
  try {
    const result = await operation();
    return { success: true, data: result };
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error with context
    console.error('Game operation failed:', {
      operation: operation.name,
      error: error.message,
      stack: error.stack,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    
    // Graceful degradation
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Multi-Platform Testing
```markdown
**Essential Testing Routine:**
- Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (all major platforms)
- Mobile: iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 90+
- Performance: 60fps desktop, 30fps+ mobile
- Compatibility: Test after every significant change
- User Experience: Regular testing with unfamiliar users
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Example: Built-in performance monitoring
class PerformanceMonitor {
  constructor() {
    this.metrics = {
      frameTime: [],
      memoryUsage: [],
      inputLatency: []
    };
  }
  
  trackFrame(frameTime) {
    this.metrics.frameTime.push(frameTime);
    if (this.metrics.frameTime.length > 60) {
      this.metrics.frameTime.shift();
    }
    
    // Alert on performance issues
    const avgFrameTime = this.getAverageFrameTime();
    if (avgFrameTime > 16.67) { // Below 60fps
      this.reportPerformanceIssue('frame_rate', avgFrameTime);
    }
  }
}
```

## Project Management Best Practices

### Stage Transition Management
```markdown
**Successful Stage Transitions:**
1. Complete current stage success criteria fully
2. Run comprehensive stage transition assessment
3. Document lessons learned and carry-forward items
4. Update project configuration for new stage
5. Migrate knowledge base appropriately
6. Test context continuity in new stage setup
```

### Risk Management
```markdown
**Proactive Risk Mitigation:**
- Technical Risk: Regular architecture reviews, performance monitoring
- Process Risk: Consistent workflow discipline, documentation hygiene
- Context Risk: Never skip consolidation, maintain decision history
- Quality Risk: Continuous testing, user feedback integration
- Scope Risk: Regular priority assessment, feature scope management
```

### Stakeholder Communication
```markdown
**Effective Progress Communication:**
- Weekly Status: Use weekly review template output
- Milestone Reports: Include metrics, demos, next steps
- Issue Escalation: Provide context, impact assessment, proposed solutions
- Success Celebration: Share achievements and lessons learned
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
